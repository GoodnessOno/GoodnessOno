### Hi there 👋🏼👋🏼
I am a Software engineer currently focused on front-end, with interests in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, and an author. I enjoy building things and that is what led me to become a Software Engineer despite having a law undergraduate degree.

I am particularly curious about how technology can be used to change the world, so I have a keen interest in the SDGs and carry out most of my AI and Robotics activities towards the attainment of these goals.
