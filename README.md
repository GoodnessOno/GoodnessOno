### Hi there 👋🏼👋🏼
I am an Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Engineer, and an author. I enjoy buidling things and that is what led me to becoming an AI and Robotics Engineer despite having a law undergraduate degree.

I am particulary curious about how technology can be used to change the world, so I have keen interest in the SDGs and carry out most of my AI and Robotics activities towards the attainment of this goals.

**PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES**
